																			<h3> SENSORS </h3>
																			<ol>
																				<li>INS ( Inertial Navigation System)</li>
																					<ul>
																						<li>
																						An inertial navigation system (INS) is a navigation aid that uses a computer, motion sensors (accelerometers)
																						and rotation sensors (gyroscopes) to continuously calculate via dead reckoning the position, orientation, 
																						and velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references. 
																						It comprises an IMU and sometimes a GPS unit too. Further, the IMU has angular and linear 
																						accelerometers (for changes in position); 
																						some IMUs include a gyroscopic element (for maintaining an absolute angular reference) .An inertial measurement
																						unit works by detecting the current rate of acceleration using one or more accelerometers, and detects changes in 
																						rotational attributes like pitch, roll and yaw using one or more gyroscopes. And some also include a magnetometer, 
																						mostly to assist calibrate against orientation drift.
																						We use Vectornav's VN-200 rugged which incorporates a wide assortment of inertial sensors including a 3-axis 
																						accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer, a barometric pressure sensor and a GPS module.

																						<br><br>
																						A laser rangefinder (or light radar) is a sensor that uses a laser beam to determine the distance to obstacles in front
																						of it. The most common form of laser rangefinder operates on the time of flight principle by sending a laser pulse in a 
																						narrow beam towards the object and measuring the time taken by the pulse to be reflected off the target and returned to 
																						the sender, by looking at the phase of the returned beam.
																						LIDAR is becoming more and more popular as a guidance system for autonomous vehicles. The speed and accuracy of a scanner 
																						means that data can be passed to a system to process the return in more or less real-time. This allows the device controlling 
																						the vehicle to detect obstacles and to update its route in a very small amount of time.
																						Since the LIDAR involves the use of low power laser, the device temperature rises and this may spoil the performance 
																						of the device. Also, indoor LIDARs are not designed to work in daylight and the presence of any highly illuminated object 
																						gives absurd results.
																						</li>
																					</ul>
																				<li class="topics">OMNIDIRECTIONAL CAMERA</li>
																					<ul>
																						<li>It is a special type of camera that can capture, at any instant a full 360 degree view of a scene from a single point. 
																						In robotics, it is of importance as it does away with the need of multiple cameras to capture the whole surroundings of 
																						the robot, concurrently stitching the whole view to present a single image. An omnidirectional camera can be used to 
																						create panoramic images in real time, without the need for post processing, and will typically give much better quality output.
																						This can be basically used to alarm the vehicle of approaching dangers from all directions.
																						</li>

																						<br>
																					</ul>
																				<li class="topics">STEREO CAMERA</li>
																					<ul>
																						<li>A Stereo camera is a camera that has two lenses about the same distance apart as your eyes and takes two pictures at the 
																						same time. This simulates the way we actually see and therefore creates the 3D effect when viewed. A stereo vision system is 
																						designed to extract 3D information from digital images and use these for examining the position of objects in two images, to 
																						build an advanced object recognition system that recognizes objects in different arrangements. Among the advantages of a stereo
																						vision system can be included its reliability and effectiveness in extracting various 
																						information (like color, or dimension), it can be used for different vision routines like tracking or 
																						detecting objects, and it’s a passive sensor which cannot be influenced by environment. The stereo camera basically works upon
																						the difference or shift in the images of the same object from the two lenses. This allows the depth calculation and hence the 3D effect.

																			<h3>ACTUATORS</h3>
																			<p>
																			An actuator is a type of motor that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. An actuator is the mechanism by which a control 
																			system acts upon an environment.
																			</p>
																			<ol>
																				<li>Hydraulic</li>
																				<ul>
																					<li>A hydraulic actuator consists of a cylinder or fluid motor that uses hydraulic power to facilitate mechanical operation. The mechanical
																						motion gives an output in terms of linear, rotary or oscillatory motion. Because liquid is nearly incompressible, a hydraulic actuator 
																						can exert considerable force, but is limited in acceleration and speed.
																					</li>
																				</ul>
																				<li>Pneumatic</li>
																				<ul>
																					<img src="images/Research/Sensors/pic5.png"/>
																					<li>A pneumatic actuator converts energy formed by vacuum or compressed air at high pressure into either linear or rotary motion. Pneumatic energy
																					is desirable for main engine controls because it can quickly respond in starting and stopping as the power source does not need to be stored in 
																					reserve for operation.
																					Pneumatic actuators enables large forces to be produced from relatively small pressure changes. These forces a	re often used with valves to move 
																					diaphragms and so affect the flow of liquid through the valve.
																					</li>
																				</ul>
																				<li>Electric</li>
																				<p>	
																				An electric actuator is powered by a motor that converts electrical energy to mechanical torque. The electrical energy is used to actuate equipment 
																				such as multi-turn valves. It is one of the cleanest and most readily available forms of actuator because it does not involve oil.
																				</p>
																				<li>Mechanical</li>
																				<li>
																					A mechanical actuator functions by converting rotary motion into linear motion to execute movement. It involves gears, rails, pulleys, chains 
																					and other devices to operate.
																					<dl><i>
																						<dt>Screw:</dt>
																						<dd> lead-screw, screw jack, ball screw and roller screw actuators all operate on the principle of the simple machine known as the screw. 
																						By rotating the actuator's nut, the screw shaft moves in a line.
																						</dd>
																					<br>
																					<img src="images/Research/Sensors/pic6.png">
																					<br>
																						<dt>Wheel and axle:</dt>
																						<dd> Hoist, winch, rack and pinion, chain drive, belt drive, rigid chain and rigid belt actuators operate on the principle of the wheel 
																						and axle. A rotating wheel moves a cable, rack, chain or belt to produce linear motion.
																						</dd>
																					<br>
																						<dt>Cam:</dt>
																						<dd> Cam actuators function on a principle similar to that of the wedge, but provide relatively limited travel. As a wheel-like cam 
																						rotates, its eccentric shape provides thrust at the base of a shaft.
																						</dd>

																			<h2><b>Types of motors</b></h2>
																			<h3><b>Stepper motor</b></h3>
																			<p>
																			A stepper motor is an electromechanical device which converts electrical pulses into discrete mechanical movements. The shaft or spindle of a 
																			stepper motor rotates in discrete step increments when electrical command pulses are applied to it in the proper sequence. The motors rotation 
																			has several direct relationships to these applied input pulses. The sequence of the applied pulses is directly related to the direction of motor
																			shafts rotation. The speed of the motor shafts rotation is directly related to the frequency of the input pulses and the length of rotation is 
																			directly related to the number of input pulses applied
																			</p>
																			<br/>
																			<img src="images/Research/Sensors/pic8.png">
																			<br>
																			<h3><b>Servo motor</b></h3>
																			<p>
																			There are some special types of application of electrical motor where rotation of the motor is required for just a certain angle not continuously 
																			for long period of time. For these applications some special types of motor are required with some special arrangement which makes the motor to 
																			rotate a certain angle for a given electrical input (signal). For this purpose servo motor comes into picture. This is normally a simple DC motor
																			which is controlled for specific angular rotation with help of additional servomechanism (a typical closed loop feedback control system).
																			</p>
																			<br><br>
																			<h3><b>Mechanism</b></h3>
																			<br><br>																			
																				A servo system mainly consists of three basic components - a controlled device, a output sensor, a feedback system.
																				This is an automatic closed loop control system. Here instead of controlling a device by applying variable input signal, the device is controlled 
																				by a feedback signal generated by comparing output signal and reference input signal.
																				When reference input signal or command signal is applied to the system, it is compared with output reference signal of the system produced by output
																				sensor, and a third signal produced by feedback system. This third signal acts as input signal of controlled device. This input signal to the device
																				presents as long as there is a logical difference between reference input signal and output signal of the system. After the device achieves its 
																				desired output, there will be no longer logical difference between reference input signal and reference output signal of the system. Then, third signal
																				produced by comparing theses above said signals will not remain enough to operate the device further and to produce further output of the system until
																				the next reference input signal or command signal is applied to the system. Hence the primary task of a servomechanism is to maintain the output of a 
																				system at the desired value in the presence of disturbances.
