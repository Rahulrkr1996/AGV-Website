																			<h3> Introduction </h3>
																			<p> A computer vision system processes images acquired from an electronic camera, which is like the human vision 
																				system where the brain processes images derived from the eyes. Computer vision is a rich and rewarding topic
																				for study and research for electronic engineers, computer scientists and many others. There are now many vision 
																				systems in routine industrial use: cameras inspect mechanical parts to check size, food is inspected for quality,
																				and images used in astronomy benefit from computer vision techniques. Forensic studies and 
																				biometrics (ways to recognize people) using computer vision include automatic face recognition 
																				and recognizing people by the 'texture' of their irises. </p>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			<h3>Our Progress so far	:</h3>
																			<p>
																			We as team AGV dream to build an autonomous car. This is viewed as replacing the manual driver with an autonomous system 
																			capable of navigating the road. An integral part in the realisation of this dream is perception. 
																			Computer vision, being the backbone of perception, has been a major focus of our team. 
																			Our major objectives have been :-
																			<br>
																			1. Removal of visible obstacles and potential dangers to the obstacle<br>
																			2. Extraction of lane boundaries from the input image to ensure the vehicle positioning wrt road<br>
																			3. Removal of remaining features that are not required for the safe locomotion of the vehicle<br>
																			4. Creation of occupancy grid map of the surrounding.<br>
																			Given the environment we are working on is dynamic, we need to experiment with various techniques for feature extraction and noise removal. Most of our work has been in developing intensity invariant algorithms and working on region independent algorithms for feature extraction. Our workflow so far has been the following :-
																			<br/><br/>
																			</p>
																			
																			<img src="images/Research/Comp_Vision/flow_chart.png">
																			<br/><br/>
																			As we tried on different algorithms and channels, we found out that the HSV colour system
																			is most favoured to remove obstacles for IGVC setup. Also, the lane segments are best retrieved 
																			for BGR color system.  The conversion of image view from perspective to top requires a matrix transform 
																			of the image by multiplying it with a transformation matrix. 
																			Also, the input image may contain information above the horizon on some occasions.The team 
																			devised a unique sky-removal algorithm to deal with this issue and this increased processing 
																			speeds by at least 25% . The algorithm works on column-wise standard mean deviation in order to 
																			determine the boundary at each column and then determines the horizon line by averaging out the 
																			boundary points at each column.
																			For lane segment extraction, blue and red channels were split, threshold value calculated and
																			finally merged. This gave least noise and best retention of lanes. 
																			The lane classification required nearest-neighbour algorithm and it classifies each lane segment
																			as left or right part. Then , we tried some lane-fitting algorithms to fill in the gaps between 
																			lane segments of same side. But since, curve regression was a very costly operation, we simply 
																			did straight line approximation of the road in close proximity of present bot location. 
																			<h4>Challenges faced:- </h4><br/>
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.<b> Obstacle removal-</b> 
																			The algorithm is limited to obstacles of certain color, such as the  
																			cones and barrels used to indicate diversion in roads, can only be removed
																			from the image. The algorithm is intensity invariant and thus does not depend 
																			on minor light changes. But the limitation of color required a separate obstacle 
																			detector , LIDAR. <br/>
  																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2. <b>Grass Removal-</b>
																			Algorithms based on certain color characteristics and image features
																			do not work well universally due to presence of different type of dry grass in
																			different areas. So, machine learning was used on the intensity invariant form 
																			of the image. This gave better results although the performance of the system 
																			was compromised. <br/>
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.<b> Lane segmentation-</b> 
																			Curve regression to complete broken lanes was very costly in
																			terms of time and space. So, we used linear approximation and setting a
																			dynamic target according to the immediate curvature of the lane. Also the image 
																			was split into various parts vertically and the part-wise mean points of each parts
																			were used for regression.This gave better results at low cost. <br/>
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.<b> Transformation matrix-</b> 
																			The transformation matrix is subject to angle of inclination and
																			position of the camera. Hence, every time the parameters are changed, it needs
																			to be calibrated properly.   
																			<br/><br/><br/>
																			<h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
																			<p>
																			We plan to work on motion analysis in the recent future. Several tasks relate to motion estimation where an 
																			image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in
																			the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images . Examples of such tasks are:
																			<br/>
																			<ul>
																				<li><b>Tracking</b> – following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or 
																				objects (e.g., vehicles or humans) in the image sequence.
																				</li>
																				<li><b>Optical flow </b>– to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to 
																				the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point
																				is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.
																				</li>
																			</ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are planning to come up with proper system and simulation
																				software to test our algorithms and plans before testing it during real-time testing on the bot. 
																			</p>

																			<h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3> <br><br>
																			<p>
																			Robot localization denotes the robot's ability to establish its own position and orientation within the frame 
																			of reference. Localization involves one question: Where is the robot now? Or, robo-centrically, where am I, 
																			keeping in mind that "here" is relative to some landmark (usually the point of origin or the destination) 
																			and that you are never lost if you don't care where you are.
																			All localization techniques generally provide two basic pieces of information:
																			<br>
																			1.What is the current location of the robot in some environment?<br>
																			2.What is the robot’s current orientation in that same environment?<br><br>
																			In order to track the current position of the robot, It uses sensors which give data along with errors.cAs the 
																			environment doesn’t behave ideally as we expect which further adds on to the error of the sensor data. So,
																			numerous filters are used to minimize the erroneous results and approximately predict the position of the robot. 
																			The commonly used filters are:<br>
																				1.Bayes Filter<br>
																				2.Kalman Filter<br>
																				3.Extended Kalman Filter<br>
																				4.Particle Filter<br>
																			<br>
																			Kalman Filter is one of the most widely used filters in mobile robotics. It is a technique from estimation theory that
																			combines the information of different uncertain sources to obtain the values of variables of interest together with the 
																			uncertainty in these.The filter has been successfully applied in many applications, like missions to Mars, and automated
																			missile guidance systems. <br>
																			
																			<br><br>
																			<img src="images/Research/Localization/1.png">
																			<br/><br/>
																			Implementation of localization requires a system and measurement models that are needed by the filter which are:<br>
																			<ul>
																				<li>A model of the Robot Kinematics</li>
																				<li>A GPS-like sensor</li>
																				<li>A landmark-based sensor.</li>
																			</ul>
																			<br><br>
																			<h3>SLAM</h3> <br><br>
																			Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a method of determining the location of a vehicle in an entirely
																			unknown environment and simultaneously mapping the environment. Its usage has grown exponentially over the recent 
																			years. It has been used in unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, planetary rovers, newly 
																			emerging domestic robots and even inside the human body.
																			SLAM consists of multiple parts:<br>
																			<ul>
																				<li>Landmark extraction</li>
																				<li>Data association</li>
																				<li>State estimation</li>
																				<li>State update</li>
																				<li>Landmark update</li>
																			</ul>

																			SLAM is applicable for both 2D and 3D motion. Mapping deals with the questions "What does the world look like ?" and 
																			localization deals with the question "Where am I ?".<br><br>
																			SLAM deals with the problem of building a model leading to a new map, or repetitively improving an existing map, while
																			at the same time localizing the robot within that map. SLAM will always use several different types of sensors to 
																			acquire data with statistically independent errors. Statistical independence is the mandatory requirement to cope with
																			metric bias and with noise in measures.The optical sensors used in SLAM are 2D lidar or a 3D lidar, 2D Cameras, Sonar. 
																			For the localization, it uses the information from odometry, IMU and GPS.<br/>

																			<h3> Introduction </h3>
																			<p>
																			Layers of control systems are required to let the robot operate at increasing level of competancy. 
																			Many higher level control system  as well as lower level control systems are applied together to
																			get a robust and flexible Robot Control System.
																			</p>
																			<h3>What is Control System and  PID Controller??</h3>
																			<p>
																			A control system is a device that manages, commands, directs or regulates the behavior of other device
																			or system.There are two common classes of control systems, open loop control systems and closed loop 
																			control systems.
																			<br>
																			PID Controller is one of the most popular and simplest controller widely used.It is a control loop feedback 
																			mechanism (controller) that calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable
																			and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process through use 
																			of a manipulated variable.
																			<br>
																			</p>																			
																			<h3>Our Approach</h3>
																			<p>
																			We are using Roboteq MDC2230 in Eklavya 3.0 which has a built in PID control loop with seperate gains for 
																			each channel and precise speed and position control and we need to set the values of K(p),K(i) and K(d).We had
																			used a microcontroller with PID controller in Eklavya 2.0 as backup in case of any malfunctioning with roboteq.	
																			</p>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			<h3>Future Goals</h3>
																			We are working on prototype for Self-Driving Car for now. Self-Driving Car consist of complex control system in
																			which simultaneous control of steering, brake,throttle and cruise control is needed. Also path following 
																			integrated with machine learning algorithms will be implemented so that our SDC can learn through human experience 
																			for better drive.

																			<h3> Introduction </h3>
																			<p>
																			This is the module that carries the essence of our purpose-autonomous navigation.
																			Motion planning is the process of breaking down a desired movement task into discrete 
																			motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement
																			Motion planning  can be divided into two:
																			<ol>
																				<li>Path planning
																					<ul>
																						<li>using path planning algorithms</li>
																						<li>using machine learning algorithms</li>
																					</ul>
																				</li>
																				<li>Obstacle avoidance
																					<ul>
																						<li>using machine learning</li>
																						<li>using sensor data</li>
																					</ul>
																				</li>
																			</ol>
																			Building upon the data feed from the sensors and subsequent processing by algorithms,the machine 
																			is instructed to move in the desired way.<br/>
																			Our team has been successful in implementing path planning algorithms to navigate our robot autonomously 
																			in IGVC 2013 and IGVC 2014.<br/>
																			Due to the huge potential carried by Machine Learning for the self-driving car,,we have separated it out 
																			as a separate module.
																			</p>
																			<h3>OUR WORK SO FAR</h3>
																			<p>
																			We have worked on Djkistra’s, A* and Quick Response algorithms for navigation,applying it on binary maps 
																			developed using the fusion of 2D Lidar data and processed image-data.
																			<br/>
																			The image processing done on the monocular camera feed to detect lanes and obstacles(static)
																			includes grass removal using machine learning,lane detection using RGB colour thresholding,fixing broken 
																			lanes using nearest neighbour algorithm and linear regression.This gives a local target to the planner, 
																			i.e - the target direction for movement of the vehicle.This was followed by Inverse Perspective Transform 
																			to convert the image into a bird’s eye view.The final image was a binary image.
																			<br/>
																			The fused binary map,referred to as the world map, was then used for path planning.The algorithm chosen 
																			finally was A* which takes the target point from the processed data and uses Quick response algorithm to 
																			provide maneuverable paths when A* fails in absence of a target point.Additionally,Distance transform was 
																			used to make the system more robust.
																			This sums up the path planning module.

																			</p>																			
																			<h3>FUTURE PLANS</h3>
																			<p>
																			The future aim is to bring in Machine learning intensively into path planning and usin D* Lite algorithm that
																			reduces time complexity considerably.Also intended is to use 3D Lidar.It is to be noted that the Mars rovers 
																			Opportunity and Spirit used D* lite for navigation.Also intended is to amalgamate odometry into path planning 
																			as a feedback system to know the position,velocity and acceleration of the bot wrt a certain origin.

																				<img src="images/Mech/steering1.gif">
																			<br>
																			<ul>
																				<li>Driving motor is attached to steering column</li>
																				<li>Both radial and axial loads come into picture</li>
																				<li>Chance for bending is more since we are having radial loads in forks</li>
																				<li>Bending Moment is maximum at the point where motor is attached</li>
																				<li>So motor get attached to the bottom part of T stem.</li>
																				<li>Maximum bending moment increases as we increase the angle with horizontal.</li>
																				<li>Bending moment is maximum in dynamic state.</li>
																			</ul>
																			<br>
																				<img src="images/Mech/steering3.png">
																			<br>
																			<h3><b>Analysis on different Scenarios</b></h3><br>
																				<br>
																				<img width="50%" src="images/Mech/steering4.png">
																		
																				<p>
																				Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics can be attributed directly to the roads on which they 
																				travel. These include:
																					<ul><i>
																						<li>Banked turn, cross slope, drainage gradient, and can't or superelevation</li>
																						<li>Road slipperiness and Split friction</li>
																						<li>Surface roughness, International Roughness Index, Profilograph, Texture</li>
																						</i>
																					</ul>
																				</p>
																				<br><br>

																			<h3>Distribution of Stress</h3>
																				<img src="images/Mech/stress1.png">
																			<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
																				<ul>
																					<li>Fork length = 25 cm </li>
																					<li>Angle with horizontal = 70</li>
																					<li>Length of steering T stem = 20 cm</li>
																					<li>Diameter of Fork = 3 cm</li>
																					<li>Thickness of fork = 3 mm</li>
																				</ul>
																				This matches with steering column of Motor bikes steering column. So concluded to use steering
																				stem and forks of Hero Honda Aviator scooter.
																				
																			<h2>Wheel Hub Assembly (Rear Wheel) in Eklavya 4.0</h3>	
																				Types Of Bearing
																				<ol>
																					<li>Ball Bearings</li>
																					<li>Thrust Bearings</li>
																					<li>Roller Bearings</li>
																				</ol>
																				<p>
																				For our design we choose tapered roller bearings Because they are capable of carrying loads
																				in both the directions i.e. axial & radial.It vanishes the necessities of thrust bearings which
																				creating a problem in disassembling.
																				</p>
																				<h3>Tapered roller bearings:</h3>
																					<p>
																					This types of bearings are generally used in all types of vehicles.In our case we uses a
																					pair of tapered roller bearings adjusted in back to back arrangements.
																					</p>
																					
																					Why back to back?<br>
																					We can arrange this bearings in 3 ways.<br>
																					1)Face to face. 2)Back to back. 3)Tandem(parallel). <br>
																					Face to face have less support width so it doesn’t provide rigid support.  
																					These arrangements are less suitable to support tilting moments due to their 
																					lower stiffness.
																				<img src="images/Mech/rearWheel1.jpg">
																				
																			<h2>Wheel Hub Assembly[Front Wheel] in Eklavya 4.0 :-</h2>	
																				<p>
																				The front wheel is driven by motor.In  our design front part doesn’t carry much load.The wheel
																				hub is quite similar to rear but have few changes. Here we use 2 roller bearings. The shaft is 
																				made in different steps & have flange welded on it.The steps are given to shaft in order to fix 
																				the bearings on it.The monsters from steering column are attached to shaft with the help of
																				bearings.  Bearings are fixed by using nut so that they can’t move in axial direction.

											<h4>Eklavya 2.0</h4>
											</b>
											<br>
											The Team participated in <b>IGVC 2013</b> using the bot <b>Eklavya 2.0</b>. This vehicle used a more advanced mechanical design and modified software architecture as compared to Eklavya 1.0.
											<br>
											<ul>
												<li> Eklavya 2.0 was one of the few bots to use <b>extruded aluminium rods</b> for 
												the chassis(it provides support for fastening all along the rod) and 
												<b> Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP)</b> for lamination and water proofing instead 
												of the heavier Perspex.The sheer torque and power was also increased leading to better turns around tight corners.
												</li>
												<li>Chain based transmission was implemented for decreasing the loading on the motor shafts.
												</li>
												<li>Wheel Odometer was implemented to estimate the position of the robot based on the 
												observed wheel velocities sensed by wheel encoders.
												</li>
												<li>Extended Kalman Filter was implemented to improve the accuracy of the localization 
												algorithm beyond the 2.5 m limit set by the GPS/INS system.
												</li>
												<li>The entire code base was shifted to the <b>ROS platform</b>, which is the 
												state of the art robotics platform used worldwide.
												</li>
												<li>A blob based image filter was implemented in the lidar as part of pre­processing
												to remove the noise that appeared due to sunlight in an indoor lidar. The low cost indoor
												LIDAR (an outdoor version costs almost 3 times) was modified so that it could be used in
												outdoor environments as well as strong sunlight.
												</li>
												<li>A robust shadow removal algorithm was implemented which could deal with strong shadows
												and recover lanes from dark regions in the image.
												</li>
												<li>A distance transform based planning algorithm was implemented to create paths that 
												naturally avoids obstacles and reach the target while ensuring that the planner would 
												not get stuck in local minima.
												</li>
												<li>The Gazebo simulator was used in parallel to development on the master platform. 
												This helped to figure out high level issues with the code flow, planning and strategy
												</li>

												<b><h4>Eklavya 3.0</h4></b>
												<br>
												It was used to compete in IGVC 2014. Having tasted success, the team went in for a lot of experimentation this time. Some of the new
												features of this bot which are listed below:
												<br>
													1.  Implementation of <b>Machine Learning algorithm</b> to remove dead grass from the image processed by the camera 
													for better lane detection.
												<br>
												2. The Team performed an <b>Inverse Perspective Transform (IPT) </b> of the camera image to get a bird’s eye view. 
													This allowed us to fuse the Lidar data with the lane data.
												<br>
												3. The vehicle used two cameras at different angles of inclination for better lane detection. This made it possible to 
													remove the blind spot close to the bot.
												<br>
												4. The path planning algorithm was shifted from A-star planning algorithm used in Eklavya 2.0 (based on the availability 
													of the global terrain map) to Quick Reflex planner(a greedy planner, based on local map) in Eklavya 3.0.
												<br>
												5. We also implemented Voronoi edge detection along with distance transform (OpenCV library) to improve the heuristics of 
													A-star and quick reflex planner. The heuristics obtained from Voronoi edge diagrams, replaced the previously used 
													Euclidean and Manhattan heuristics. The implementation of Distance transform in linear time was also one of our key 
													successes in IGVC 2014.
